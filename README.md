### Predictive Modelling for music genres classification

# Problem Description:

# Objective:
Build a predictive model that is capable of predicting the music genres based on the given set of features

# Features:
* Acousticness: The relative metric of the track being acoustic
* Danceability: The relative measurement of the track being danceable
Duration_ms: The length of track in milliseconds(ms)
Energy: The primary identifier for the track, generated by Spotify
Instrumentalness: The relative ratio of the track being instrumental
Liveness: The relative duration of the track sounding as a live performance 
Loudness: Relative loudness of the track in the typical range 
Speedchiness: The relative length of the track containing any kind of human voice
Tempo: The tempo of the track in Beat Per Minute (BPM)
Valence:The positivity of the track
Key: The primary key of the track encoded as integers in between 0 and 11
Mode: The binary value representing whether the track starts with a major (1) chord progression or not (0)
